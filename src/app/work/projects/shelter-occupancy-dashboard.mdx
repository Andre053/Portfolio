## Overview

This project will aim to create an interactive dashboard for the Toronto shelter system.

## Ideas

The purpose of the dashboard should be to show the current state of the shelter system. 

In understanding the state of the system, the most important metrics will be: 
- Total daily services users: How it changes over time, how it differs between 
FSA, neighbourhood, etc.
- Total occupied and unoccupied beds
- Total occupied and unoccupied rooms
- Total active programs
- Total active shelters

Drill down functionality
- By timeframe
- By FSA
- By neighbourhood
- By shelter
- By program type (transitional or emergency)
- By sector
