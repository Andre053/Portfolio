## Overview

A Next.js application that visualizes my analysis of the Overnight Shelter Occupancy
dataset as provided by Open Data Toronto. This was built off a 
[previous project](https://github.com/Andre053/Toronto-Daily-Shelter-Overnight-Service-Usage)
that aimed to more generally explore the dataset through visualizations. The 
visualizations shown in this analysis were taken from that exploration. This site is 
currently live, hosted in Vercel. 

## Key Features

- **Feature 1**: Interactive line charts for displaying trends over time.
- **Feature 2**: Interactive map of Toronto for visualizing the data. 
- **Feature 3**: Data analysis and reflection. 

## Data sources

- **Open Data Toronto**
- **Canada Census Boundary Files**
- **Canada Addresses**
- **Map of Toronto ShapeFile**

## Technologies Used

Client
- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development.
- **D3**: For creating web-based plots and maps.
- **Mux**: For advanced components.

Data exploration, analysis, and processing
- **Python**: Used libraries such as pandas, NumPy,... to analyze prepare and analyze data. Processed data into JSON for client-side display.

Hosting
- **GitHub**: Source control and connecting to Vercel. 
- **Vercel**: For hosting the application online.
- **Cloudflare**: For configuring the application to utilize my personal domain.

## Challenges and Learnings

Most of the challenges of creating web-based visualizations with D3 were tackled in the prior project.

I wanted to host this application online, which proved to be a simple process by using Vercel. 
As I had already set my domain up with Cloudflare, it was also easy to create a sub-domain for
the project. 

I implemented dynamic display of the visualizations using Viewbox with D3, as previously I had 
simply set the size of the plots manually. Viewbox implementation was fairly routine, but made 
more difficult due to the repeated code from having two line chart functions to handle single
and multiple data sources, respectively. In future D3 projects, I would better plan out my visualization functions as to make more flexible
charts within the same function. 

## Outcome

A simple data analysis project was produced that is hosted online, utilized interactive D3 
charts and maps, and included my general observations. I used Python for data processing and
analysis, then exported JSON files for use by D3 in the frontend. Next.js proved a useful 
framework for creating web apps that can display data analyses, with ample room to expand on
the functionality and features.
