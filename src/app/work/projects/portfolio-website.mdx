## Creating my portfolio website

A portfolio website has a lot of potential to express more of yourself to others. 

It is useful for looking for work or sharing what you've done or are interested in with others. 

But it can also act as a journal. 

When creating my portfolio website, I wanted something that utilized software technologies I was interested in while minizmizing my costs.

Beyond being an enhanced resume, I wanted the portfolio to be a place for me to create and share content, mainly related to my studies, projects, and hobbies. 

A quick Google search for Next.js portfolio templates brought me to [Magic portfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/magic-portfolio-for-next-js).
