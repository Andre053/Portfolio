## Creating a portfolio website

I have been wanting to have an online portfolio for some time now to display my work, studies, and interests. 
I previously created simple HTML sites of my own, but always got burnt out as 
I tried to improve them. When creating my portfolio website, I wanted something that 
utilized software technologies I was interested in while minizmizing my costs.
Recently, I have been using Next.js in various projects and I was once again interested 
in making a portfolio. With some quick Googling I found this Next.js template. Beyond
a simple resume, it supports blogs and projects that I can continually and easily add to. 

## Technology used
- [Magic portfolio template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/magic-portfolio-for-next-js)
- React.js with TypeScript
- Cloudflare for domain management
- Vercel for hosting

## Setting up the portfolio

After cloning the project, I began by replacing the filler content with my own. Additionally, I
made some edits to add content of my own and remove certain parts of the original app. 

The main changes I have made are: 
- Adding interests section for About page
- Editing the text on the link for each project
- Removing Once UI advertising

## Hosting

Since this is a Next.js app, it is simple to host on the Vercel platform. I had already created
an account for a different project, so I simply added the project from my account once it was
committed to GitHub. As I also have my own domain, I set up the DNS settings to utilize a sub-domain
for accessing the portfolio.

## Moving forward

I aim to make a habit of using this site as a source for my studies, projects, and writings. Beyond
career-related content, it will include my creative work in the form of articles, essays, reviews, photography, etc.
