## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a statistical data analysis approach that 
aims to summarize the main characteristics of the data. The main techniques used
in EDA are visualization and dimensionality reduction. 

In R, ggplot and dplyr libraries are great options for visualizing and 
manipulating data, respectively. 

## Steps to conducting an EDA
EDA is an iterative cycle requiring:
1. Generating questions about the data
2. Searching for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling the data
3. Use information found to refine questions and/or generate new questions

It is a creative process. The key to asking quality questions is by generating a 
large quantity of questions. 

Two types of questions are very useful:
1. What type of variation occurs within the variables?
2. What type of covariation occurs between the variables?

## Variation

Variation is the tendency of values of a variable to change between measurements. 
The variation of a distribution is best seen through visualizations. 

For categorical variables, bar charts are useful. For continuous variables, histograms are best. 

Useful questions:
- Which values are most common? Why?
- Which values are rare? Why? Does this match your expectations?
- Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?

To understand subgroups:
- How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?
- How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?
- How can you explain or describe the clusters?
- Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?

Outliers, or unusual values, stray from the pattern of the data. Identifying and handling 
outliers is crucial to further analysis efforts. 

Missing values can also cause issues in overall analysis. They should be handled initially. 

## Covariation
Covariation is the behaviour between variables within a distribution. It is the tendency for
the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. 

## Visualizations

**Bar plot**
geom_bar() or geom_col()

Display the frequency of categorical variables with the bar plot. The column chart is used 
for showing other values by category. 

**Histogram**
geom_histogram()

Display the frequency of continuous variables.

**Frequency poly plot**
geom_freqpoly()

Display the frequency of continuous variables as a line graph. Can also show
separate categorical variables. Displaying count can cause an issue when the 
overall counts of categorical variables differ significantly. In this case, 
display density instead, the standardized count so that the area under each
frequency polygon is one. 

**Box and whisker plot**
geom_boxplot()

Display the distribution of a continuous variable with indicators for quartiles, 
whisker for non-outliers, and separate outliers.

**Count plot**
geom_count()

Display the covariation between categorical variables. The size of each circle displays
how correlated they are. 

**Tile plot**
geom_tile()

Alternative to the count plot, using tiles and colours instead of shapes and size to 
display the correlation. Must manipulate the data for display first.
