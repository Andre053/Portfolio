## Data dashboard (Better Evaluation 2025)
A data dashboard is a dynamic visual display of the most important information needed to 
achieve one or more objectives. Data in a dashboard is consolidated and arranged 
on a single screen so that the information can be monitored at a glance. 

Dashboards often include multiple visualizations and minimal text to describe the displayed
indicators. Their application spans industry, but is commonly used to monitor performance
of projects, programs, teams, organizations, etc.; in these situations, dashboards should 
aspire to track performance in an engaging manner and support timely interventions. 

**Key characteristics**
- All visualizations fit on a single screen
- Only the most important indicators to be monitored over time are displayed
- Regular updates of the data are made (should be automatic)
- Simple to understand and used by anyone with accessbility
- Often includes filtering and drill down functions to enable deeper analysis

Well-designed dashboards transform data repositories into consumable information. 

## Using Dash for data Dashboards
Dash is a Python framework for creating interactive web-based dashboards. Being
Python-based, it is generally easy to pick up and work with. Additionally, for 
data science purposes, Dash benefits from the rich ecosystem of data libraries 
avaiable to Python.

## Understanding Dash (Dash 2025)
### Layout
The part of a Dash application that describes what the app looks like. The layout combines with
interactivity to create a fully functional dashboard. 

1. The layout is composed of a tree of "components"
2. The Dash HTML Components (dash.html) is a module with components for all HTML tags 
3. Not all components are pure HTML. The Dash Core Components (dash.dcc) contains 
higher-level components that are interactive, often using JS, HTML, and CSS
4. Each component is described entirely through keyword attributes. Dash is *declarative*
5. The children property is special. It is always the first attribute and can contain a 
string, a number, a single component, or a list of components
6. Dash app fonts can be set with a custom CSS stylesheet

Dash hot-reloads when changes are saved. 

Dash HTML components differ from HTML attributes in the following ways:
1. The *style* property in HTML is a semicolon-separated string. In Dash, use a dictionary
2. Keys in the *style* dictionary are camelCased
3. The HTML *class* attribute is *className* in Dash
4. The children of the HTMl tag is specified through the *children* keyboard argument. This
is always the first argument by convention, therefore often ommitted. 

*Graph* component in *dash.dcc* renders interactive data visualizations using the plotly.js.
It supports over 36 chart types and renders charts in vector-quality SVG and high-performance
WebGL. 

When writing blocks of text, the *Markdown* component in *dash.dcc* is usually more
developer-friendly than using Dash HTML. 

High-level components like dropdowns, graphs, markdown blocks, etc. are available in *dash.dcc*.
Every component is described declaratively and is configurable with keyword arguments. 

### Callbacks
Dash uses callback functions for interactivity. Callback functions are called whenever a Dash input
component's property changes, allowing for an update to be made. 

Optimal user-interaction and chart loading performance should consider:
1. The Job Queue
2. HPC
3. Datashader
4. Horizontal scaling capabilities

**Basic callbacks**
1. Inputs and outputs of an application are described as the arguments of the *@callback* decorator
2. Inputs and outpus are simply the properties of a particular component
3. Whenever an input property changes, the callback function gets called automatically. Dash
provides this callback function witht he new value of the input property as its argument and
updates the property of the output component with whatever is returned by the function
4. The *component_id* and *component_property* keywords are optional
5. The *dash.dependencies.Input* object and *dcc.Input* object are different. The former 
is used in callback definitions, the latter is an actual component
6. When Dash start, it automatically calls all of the callbacks with the initial values 
of the input components to populate the initial state of the output components

The *@callabck* decorator:
1. Tells Dash to call this function whenever the value of the "input" component changes in
order to update the children of the "output" component on the page
2. The function within the decorator can be named anything. By convention, the name should
describe the callback output(s)
3. The function arguments can have any name and they are positional by default; first the 
*Input* items and then any *State* items
4. The same *id* of a Dash component in *app.layout* must be used when referring to it 
as an input or output of the *@callback* decorator
5. The decorator must be directly above the callback function declaration

Dash apps can have multiple inputs or outputs. 

Callbacks can be chained.

Components can be passed into callbacks. 

Dash apps can have a state.

### Interactive visualizations
The *Graph* component in *dash.dcc* uses plotly.js for creating interactive vizualizations.

The *figure* argument in the *Graph* component is the same *figure* argument used by *plotly.py*.

The *Graph* component has 4 attributes that can change through user-interaction: *hoverData*,
*clickData*, *selectedData*, and *relayoutData*.

Limitations on graph interactions include the inability to customize the style of hover interactions
or the select box. 

### Sharing data between components
Dash was designed to be stateless, but allows for state to be shared. Data can be shared 
in 3 places:
1. The user's browser session, using *dcc.Store*
2. On the disk, ex. in a file of databases
3. In server-side RAM that is shared across processes and servers, such as a Redis database

NOTE: Global variables will break your app!

### Publishing your app
Dash apps can be easily published to Plotly Cloud or Dash Enterprise. Plotly Cloud can be 
used for free is managed by Plotly; Dash Enterprise is a premier product that is installed
on the cloud services of AWS, Azure, or Google.
