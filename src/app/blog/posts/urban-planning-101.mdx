## Urban planning
Urban planning is a cross-disicipline applied social science that focuses on
decision-making regarding policies and approaches to urban issues, often with the
aim of improving the public good. It is a vast field that has wide-ranging 
responsibilities and roles in the city. Typical tasks for urban planers include the
development and recommendations of plans and policies to manage urban land use, 
physical facilities, and services. 

Both public sector and private sector organizations employ urban planners. The 
most direct work is for governments, either as an employee or a consultant. Urban
planners can also find work in analysis and advocacy.  


## Roles of urban planners
*Visionaries* of the future of cities, considering influencing factors like population 
growth, economic development, and environmental responsibility. 

*Designers* of the physical layout of cities, from zoning and land use to transportation 
systems and public spaces.

*Policymakers* that develop and implement government policy to guide urban development
that is aligned with community goals and values.

*Problem solvers* who need to address issues like housing affordability, traffic
congestion, and climate change resilience. 

*Community advocates* that engage with residents, businesses, and stakeholders so that
the decisions made reflect the needs and aspirations of the community they should support. 

## Types of urban planning
1. Strategic urban planning

The setting of high-level goals within areas of desired growth.

2. Land-use planning

Creation of legislation and policy to influence land use. May use planning instruments 
such as governmental statues, regulations, rules, codes, and policies. 

3. Master planning

Complete plans for the creation of a new (or renewed) urban area.

4. Urban revitalization

Planning to improve areas that are stated to be in a state of decline. 

5. Economic development

The identification of areas of growth to foster urban financial prosperity. 

6. Environmental planning

Emphasizes environmental sustainability in urban planning decision-making. 

7. Infrastructure planning 

Decision-making regarding fundamental facilities and systems that serve 
an urban population. 

## Urban planning roles

Junior planners support senior planners. They prepare and present reports on development 
proposals and collect data, reports, and maps for urban research. They may coordinate
community review of development projects and help resolve stakeholder issues. 

Land use planners create plans to meet the needs of communities while preserving the
natural environment. Typical tasks of this role include preparing plans for environmental
protection by studying the physical land and an area's community of where a development 
is planned. Administratively, they may process applications for land development permits
and supervise and coordinate related urban planning work. 

Transportation planners specialize in urban transit systems. Tasks include carrying out
feasibility studies, engaging in government policy, and planning construction details.
In the public sector, they often work for government bodies or contractors alongside 
professionals such as transport engineers, developers, and environmental planners. In
the private sector, they may work for public companies as consultants.

Land surveyors are responsible for determing the legal boundaries of property. They 
conduct surveys that combine data and legal documents relevant to land sought for 
development. Tasks include executing physical site surveys, preparing reports, and
collecting data. They need to be able to verify the accuracy of survey data to prepare
documents or present findings.

Landscape architects are the designers of urban areas, for both aesthetic and functional
purposes. They ensure that the planned developments are compatible with the chosen natrual 
environment, considering factors that could result in issues during development. 

Urban designers create the ideas that are the base of an urban area. Their role is to 
bring the practical developments to life as useful and enjoyable areas.

## Urban design vs. urban planning
Both fields are closely related, but differ in their focus. Urban planning is broader,
more technical and political, and focused on strategy, structure, and policy. It considers
the overall development and growth of urban areas. Urban design is centred 
on the specific details of design and aesthetics in urban areas. Urban planners create
the framework for urban design to be materialized.

## Technology and urban planning
Improvements in technology have provided many tools for urban planners and new strategies. 
Smart cities use sensors to gather vast amounts of urban data to enable real-time monitoring
or urban systems, allowing for opimization in various areas. Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) tools provide powerful spatial analysis capabilities for visualizing and 
analyzing urban data. 3D modeling and visualization technologies allow the creation of 
virtual models of proposed developments. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
provide interactive ways for stakeholders to experience proposed urban changes. 

## Urban planning in local government
Due to the local nature of urban planning, local governments are key to ensuring that
the decisions made are right for the community. Typical responsibilities of these 
governments are:
- Zoning and land use regulations
- Transportation planning
- Housing policy
- Economic development
- Environmental protection 

## Administrative responsibilities
Regulatory compliance requires that urban development projects comply with government
regulations within the area. 

Interagency coordination promotes collaboration between government agencies to improve 
planning efforts. 

Resource allocation is the efficient distribution of resources to support development.
