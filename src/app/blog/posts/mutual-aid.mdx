## What is mutual aid?

Mutual aid is an approach to community support where resources and services
are voluntarily and collaboratively exchanged for the common benefit of the 
community, specifically to overcome social, economic, and political barriers 
to meeting common needs. Those aspiring to provide mutual aid often form 
organizations based on these principles. It is a form of solidarity-based support,
relying on community members volunteering their own time to help others.

The term comes from the theory that cooperation, not competition, was the driving
mechanism behind evolution. Mutual aid was then believed to have pragmatic advantages
for survival, along with a ancient history in human culture. 

Those participating in mutual aid efforts work in collaboration with each other to
determine strategies and resources to meet each other's needs. Organizing often
goes further to include activism against the system that created the shortage. 

## Approaches to mutual aid

Mutual aid efforts arise from communities that are lacking in support for basic needs.
Theese efforts are radical in how they take a communal approach to helping themselves.

Mutual aid groups are often:
- Member-led, with non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic structures that are egalitarian in nature
- Member-organized and controlled
- Open to all to participate in

Mutual aid groups can be supported through volunteering, monetary donations, resource
donations, community engagement, etc.

## Theory of mutual aid
The theory of mutual aid begins with the anarchist thinker Peter Kropotkin. He 
advocated for an economical system based on mutual exchanges anchored in voluntary 
cooperation. Towards this end, organized mutual aid efforts generally look to 
realize this goal on a much smaller scale within their communities. 

Mutual aid has often been considered a form of 'prefigurative politics'. 
This term includes modes of organization and social relationships that 
try to reflect the future society that is desired by the group. It is the
building of a new society within the current, and undesired, society. 

Mutual aid is a bottom-up, decentralized form of communal organization. Like 
similar bottom-up efforts, such as grassroots organizing, relies on an
informed and driven base of support.
