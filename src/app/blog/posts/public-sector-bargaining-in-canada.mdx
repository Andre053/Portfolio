## Public sector unionism in Canada (Camfield 2004)

What kinds of organizations are public sector unions in Canada? What are their objectives, 
character, and ideologies?

**Importance of public sector unions**
In 2002, public sector unionists made up 53.5% of all union members. Public sector workers 
are 4 times more likely to be union members than their private sector counterparts.

**Influence of public sector on the labour movement**
1. Over half of all unionists are working in the public sector
2. Some public sector unions have distinguished themselves by committing to public
campaigning and mobilizing members against neoliberal policies
3. The gendered character of public sector unions, much more even than private sector 
alternatives

**Restructuring of the state**
Neoliberal reforms have led to changes in the administration that have went through alongside the 
high levels of union membership. 

**The role of unions**
Not just labour organizations, but working-class movement organizations. 

## History of public sector bargaining in Canada (Rose 2004)
**Expansionary years (mid-1960s to 1982)**

Notable policy changes:
- Adoption of enabling legislation
- Anti-Inflation Program, 1975

This stage was the first divergence from traditional public administration, leading to significant
transformations in public sector labour relations. Enabling legislation was adopted, which led to 
collective bargaining among federal and provincial governments, followed by the broader public sector. 
There was a rapid expansion of public sector union membership, sustained by expanding public sector
employment and union security agreements. 

Even here, the scope of bargaining in the public sector has been narrower than the private sector.
Federal and provincial statutes restricted what could be bargained, but there were no significant
restrictions imposed on public sector bargaining during this stage. 

In the mid-1970s, federal wage and price controls were introduced in the form of the Anti-inflation
Program, an attempt to reduce the high rates of inflation resulting from the gulf war. These policies
constrained bargaining for a 3-year period and established flexible annual wage guidelines; wage 
settlements that exceeded the guidelines were rolled back and guidelines lowered wage expectations, 
contributing to lower wage settlements.

**The restraint years (1982 to 1990)**

Notable policy changes:
- Public Sector Compensation Act, 1982 (the "6 and 5" Program)
- Provincial wage restraint measures

This stage began with the adoption of the "6 and 5" Program during another period of high inflation.
The legislation aimed to restrain public sector pay increases, setting the tone for private sector
wage bargaining. It imposed a 6% ceiling on wage increases in 1982, and 5% the following year. Beyond
restraining settlements, it extended collective agreements in place by 2 years, suspending any upcoming
collective bargaining. Towards this, it eliminated the right to strike and access to interest arbitration,
precluded negotiations over all issues, and rolled back negotiated wage settlements exceeding the 6%
and 5% maxima. These additional features of the legislation made a damaging impact on public sector 
bargaining. 

While broadly accepted by the provinces, there were differences in the resulting legislation
that was adopted. In British Columbia, the Public Sector Restraint Act allowed employers to
terminate employees without any regard for job security. Operation Solidarity led to the
government granting exemptions from these restrictions. 

Public sector wage restraint measures were justified by government due to the need to stop
inflation and gain stability after the recent recession. These policies can also be seen as 
a backlash against the "excesses" of bargaining in the 1970s. They would also become the
precursor to more permanent and restrictive changes to public sector bargaining. The rest of
the 1980s saw moderate wage settlements and declined strike activity, alongside a slowdown in
public employment and public sector union membership growth.

**The retrenchment years (1990 to 1998)**

Notable policy changes:
- Shift from combating inflation to combating government spending (austerity)
- Social Contract Act (Ontario)
- Successor rights provisions for Crown employees removed, 1995 (Ontario)
- Cut spending rather than increase taxes
- NPM adoption

This stage, was driven by government policies that increasingly relied on markets, following
the Western 1990s recession and large budget deficits being held. The resulting policies 
differed from the previous stage as they were targetted at reducing budget deficits, controlling
spending, and reducing public debt rather than inflation. These measures also went beyond wage 
restraints, including downsizing, restructuring, and redefining the role of government and its
delivery of public services. Legal infringements were most often confined to compensation issues;
wherever they were adopted, they included measures like wage freezes, wage rollbacks, the 
extension of collective agreements, and unpaid leaves of absence. This resulted in reduced take
home pay and the ending of negotiations of wage improvements.

Legislative action was overwhelmingly in the governments' favour, making it a heavily preferred 
approach in place of adversarial collective bargaining. In Ontario, once bargaining failed to 
bring consensus, the government passed the Social Contract Act. 

This legislative approach was supported by the business community and financial markets, and the
general public could be sold on its merits. Legislative measures used included:
- Restrictions on the right to strike
- Wage restraints (freezes, rollbacks, or limited increases)
- Extension of collective agreements
- Unpaid leaves of absence
- Suspending access to interest arbitration (federal)
- Altering arbitral criteria and the process for appointing arbitrators

Other legislation passed included measures to limit or foreclose bargaining over matters
related to job security. These attempted to dismantle strong agreements that had been 
reached through bargaining of consultation. The government saw them as barriers to 
achieving significant job cuts. In Ontario, the successor rights provisions for Crown
employees were removed in 1995.

The federal Workforce Adjustment Directive Agreement (WFAD) was developed by the National
Join Council (NJC) but was deemed to be incompatible with government reduction goals. The 
government then instituted changes to the WFAD to cut jobs, suspend the agreement, and to 
transfer public sector workers to the private sector at a lower wage rate.

In Ontario, 1997, the province deemed that workload and class size would become statutory
terms of employment upon the expiry of the teachers' collective agreements. This was done
for the purpose of reducign teaching positions and expenditures. 

Beyond legal restrictions, bargaining outcomes were sought to be controlled by imposing
restrictions on interest arbitration. In 1996, the federal "choice-of-procedures" model was changed
to suspend access to interest arbitration for 3 years. In Ontario, laws were altered to modify
arbitral criteria and the process for appointing arbitrators. 

Overall, reductions in government spending contributed to curtailing public services and 
declining public employment rates. There was low union growth, or even membership losses, 
during this period. The downward trend of wage settlements and strike activity continued. 
Legal restrictions on public sector bargaining were broader than ever, and in many cases
became permanent. 

**The consolidation years (1998 to 2004)**

In the latter half of the 1990s, the budgetary crises subsided and economic conditions
improved. It was a period of sustained economic growth, budget stability, and continued
fiscal vigilance. Instead of seeing a rise of public sector bargaining, governments and
public sector employers attempted to consolidate the gains of the previous period. There
would be a continued use of hard bargaining and reliance on legislation to restrict
bargaining rights, preserve gains, and, in some cases, secure additional gains. With the
lack of budgetary pressures, this period had less urgency behind its strategies of 
weakening public sector bargaining. 

New public management practices had risen throughout the previous periods, and its adoption
would continue as further efforts wre made to improve efficiency. Viable strategies still
included downsizing, privatization, and contracting out public sector work. 

The government strategy has been overall less about being anti-union, but about constraining
union power. This can be seen in regards to:
- Structure: Maintaining consolidating bargaining structures
- Process: Regulating the right to strike and the arbitration process
- Outcomes: Restricting bargaining subjects and wage settlements

This strategy by governments reflects 3 key considerations:
1. Desire to maintain fiscal stability and flexibility by recasting the bargaining model
2. Rejection of a return to normalization, a desire for enduring results
3. Political cost of interfering with collective bargaining is only modest
