## Why practice storytelling?
As someone with a STEM background who often avoided or slacked through reading and writing
hobbies and assignments, I've never felt confident in my storytelling abilities. While I 
have always loved to absorb stories, whether told by others or through media like TV and 
movies, I have rarely tried to create my own stories. 

In an effort to build confidence in my ability to create and communicate stories, I have 
done what I do best, find resources on the internet that can help teach me skills. The 
following are some of my key takeaways from these studies. 

## Principles of storytelling (University of Colorado)

1. Tell your story as if you're telling it to a friend
2. Set the place, time, setting, and any relevant context
3. Action! Use action verbs
4. Juxtapose ideas, images, thoughts, places, etc. Hegal: in posing two opposing ideas,
a whole new one is created (thesis + antithesis = synthesis)
5. Gleaming detail: choose an ordinary moment or object that becomes a gleaming detail; 
capturing and embodying the essence of the story
6. "Hand over the Spark:" reflect on the experience of idea that originall captivated you,
simply hand it to your audience
7. Be vulnerable: date to share the emotion of your story. Explore the questions you 
faced along the way
8. Tune in to your sense memory, use the strongest ones to make a deeper connection with
your audience. There is always a dominant sense that dominates every memory
9. Bring yourself to the story
10. Let go of the story, letting it build to its natural, emotional punchline, then end it
and get out fast; leave the audience wanting more

## Techniques (Storylab)
1. Story spine
Pick a random topic and make up a story on the spot. To train your understanding
of story structures, a typical story prompt may help.

2. Watch and critique
Watch or listen to stories live or through media and review them critically. It
helps to train observational storytelling skills and identify the practices that
best work for you. The main questions to ask are:
- What was the overall arc of the story?
- Which stylistic elements were used?
- What did you like about the story?
- What could be improved?

3. Homework for life
Every day, reflect upon one "story-worthy" moment of the day. Write down the date
and a one-sentence summary of the moment. This will help you to:
- Recognize that you have dozens of interesting stories
- Be more mindful and open-minded each day
- Recognize patterns in your thoughts and behaviours

4. Dialogue impersonation
Practice impersonating the dialogue of other characters within a story to help
bring it to life. To best impersonate a character, ask questions like:
- How do they stand?
- How do they speak?
- What peculiarities do they have?
