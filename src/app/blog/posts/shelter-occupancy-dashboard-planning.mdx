## Overview

This project will aim to create an interactive dashboard for the Toronto shelter system.

## The data
**Key information**
- Data first published in 2021, before was a less detailed dataset 
- Dataset is updated daily
- Mirrors the reporting from the Shelter Management Information System (SMIS) database
- Only includes records that have a value in SERVICE_USER_COUNT
- Each record represents the service user count of a specific program
- Each program is run by an organization, within a shelter, at a location 
- Program, organization, shelter, and organization each have a name field and an ID field
  - ID uniquely identifies over time, even when the name is changed 

**Programs**
- Programs are classified into two different types of models
  - Emergency: Accessed by any individual or family experiencing homelessness
  - Transitional: Provides required, specialized programming; can be accessed by eligible individuals and families by referral only
- Programs are classified into different areas, most generally as part of the base shelter and overnight services system, or part of a temporary response program; more specifically:
  - Base Shelter and Overnight Services System
  - Base Program - Refugee
  - Temporary Refugee Response
  - COVID-19 Response
  - Winter Response

**Sectors**
- Categorizes homeless shelters based on gender, age, and household size of the service user group(s) served
- Currently 5 shelter sectors
  - Adult men
  - Adult women
  - Mixed adult
  - Youth
  - Family

**Capacity type**
- Each program is categorized into either bed-based or room-based capacity

**Occupancy data**
For each program, as specified by the prior fields, there are sums of various important metrics:
- Service user count: Number of service users staying in an overnight program as of the occupancy time and date
- Capacity actual bed: Number of beds showing as available for occupancy in the SMIS
- Capacity funding bed: Number of beds that a program has been approved to provide
- Occupied beds: Number of beds showing as not occupied in the SMIS
- Unoccupied beds: Calculated number of beds showing as available for occupancy 
- Capacity actual room: Number of rooms showing as available for occupancy in the SMIS
- Capacity funding room: Number of rooms that a program has been approved to provide
- Occupied rooms: Number of rooms showing as not occupied in the SMIS
- Unoccupied rooms: Calculated number of rooms showing as available for occupancy 
- Occupancy rate beds: Proportion of actual bed capacity that is occupied
- Occupancy rate rooms: Proportion of actual room capacity that is occupied

## Ideas
The purpose of the dashboard should be to show the current state of the shelter system. 

The key questions I plan to address in this dashboard are:
- What is the current occupancy of the shelter system?
- How has the shelter system occupancy changed over time?
- How do the different parts of the shelter system compare?
  - I.e. program type, program sector, program area, capacity type
- How is the shelter system different spatially? 
- How the data changes between FSA, neighbourhood, etc.

Drill down functionality
- By timeframe
- By FSA
- By neighbourhood
- By shelter
- By program type (transitional or emergency)
- By sector

## Technologies
- Python: Easy to use language with rich data science libraries
    - Pandas: Data processing and analysis
- Dash: Framework for creating interactive web visualizations with Python
- Plotly Cloud: Free hosting for Dash applications
- Cloudflare: Proxy for domain

## Creating the project
1. Ingest the data
Data is downloaded locally as 4 CSV files using a Python script. 

2. Load the data
Data is read from each CSV file and combined into a single pandas DataFrame.

3. Prepare the data
To prepare the data for analysis, various steps are taken:
a. Data types are set
b. FSA column is added 

4. Analyze the data
Calculate statistics and tranform data for visualization. 

5. Visualize the data
Create Dash elements to show the data. 

## Dashboard layout
**Main dashboard**
- Occupancy statistics
- Program statistics 
- Occupancy plots
