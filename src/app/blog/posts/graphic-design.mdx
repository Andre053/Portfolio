## Graphic design
Graphic design skills are key to creating a plethora of content, 
such as infographics and banners. To successfully make well-designed
graphics, you must have an understanding of design theory in addition
to technical skills with various tools. 

## Graphic design principles
1. Focus on alignment
    - Centre, right, or left-aligned text is most common
    - Asymmetry can provide a unique appeal 
    - Align with other objects
2. Use hierarchy to help focus the design
    - When there are multiple visual elements, put extra weight to those most important
    - Larger or bolder fonts
    - Location on graphic (higher usually signifies more importance)
    - Using shapes to frame the central point
3. Leverage contrast to accentuate important design elements
    - Two design lements in opposition to eachother: black and white, thick and thin, modern and traditional
    - Constract lets you draw out important elements of a design to add emphasis
    - Adds variety and strategy to your design
4. Use repetition to your advantages
    - Repeating colours, fonts, words, or shapes can tie the design together and help people remember the informaiton
    - Consistent colours, fonts, brand imagery, etc. 
5. Consider proximity when organizing your graphic elements
    - Similar or related elements should be grouped together
    - Should also declutter the overall design and support the comprehension of information
    - Often employed in lists, menus, and invitations
6. Make sure your designs have balance
    - Balance gives form and stability
    - Doesn't require objects being the same size or symmetrical design; should ultimately aid comprehension
    - Symmetry weights elements evenly, asymmetry uses contrast to even out the flow of the design
7. Optimize colour to support your design
    - Colour communicates on an emotional and subconscious level
    - Basics of colour theory can help
8. Leave negative space 
    - Blank spaces create shapes and can help highlight information

## Colour theory
1. Basic colour theory
    - 12-step colour wheel developed by Sir Isaac Newton
        - Each colour is a hue
    - Must create balanced contrasts to have visual harmony and aid readability
    - Choosing colours 
        - Complementary: Directly across from each other; the most contrasting
        - Analagous:  Two or more colours in close proximity on the colour wheel; easiest on the eye
        - Split complementary: 3 colours where two are split from the main complementary colour; provides contrast with less intensity
        - Double complementary: Same as complementary, except there are two pairs now 
        - Triadic: Any 3 colours equally spaced around te colour wheel
        - Monochromatic: Tints and shades of a single colour; tints are mixed with a light colour, shades with a dark colour 
    - Visual vibrations happen when two overlapping colours seem to vibrate, making reading difficult
2. Seek inspiration
    - Look to nature, architecture, etc. and identify how colours made you feel
    - Identify the main colours of the scene
3. Understand the meaning behind colour
    - Colour exudes emotion that can enhance or distract from a message
    - Colour meanings can also be influenced by the current culture
4. Maintain consistency 
    - Consistency in the colours used creates a recognizable brand
