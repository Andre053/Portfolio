## What is spatial data science?

Spatial data science combines the use of spatial data and GIS technologies 
with the theory and tools of data science; a spatial data scientist uses data 
skills to enhance the analysis of spatial data. 

Common skills for a spatial data scientist include (Forrest 2022):
- Data processing/ETL/ELT to prepare data for analysis
- Spatial SQL to be able to interface with large spatial databases
- QGIS or similar GIS software for quick visualization of spatial data 
- Geospatial Python for analyzing spatial data using Python libraries, 
while also enabling the integration with other data science libraries
- Jupyter notebooks for creating analysis notebooks with Python
- Spatial statistics and ML to analyze the data


## My focus
I want to build my spatial data science skills so that I can better:
1. Analyze what is happening
2. Provide context to observations
3. Connect insights to public policy choices

I want to focus my spatial data science studies on skills needed for analyzing issues
such as housing, income, accessibility to services, government accountability, and 
public service delivery; especially in an urban setting. I also want my analysis to 
evaluate government programs where possible, therefore requiring policy analysis skills,
both statistical and academic; to share these analyses, data storytelling will be crucial. 

## My top skills to build
1. Spatial statistics and ML approaches
2. Spatial SQL advanced uses
3. Geospatial and data science Python libraries 
### Spatial statistics and ML
#### Common methods of analysis (Wikipedia 2025)
**Multivariable analysis or Factor analysis**
- Allows a change of variables, transforming the many variables of a data source, 
usually correlated between themselves, into fewer independent "Principal Components"
- The principal conponents, or factors, are the eigenvectors of the data correlation matrix
- This change of variables has two main advantages:
    1. Only a small amount of information is lost while many factors are dropped, mapping
    then produces fewer and more significant maps
    2. The factors are orthogonal by construction (not correlated). The dominant factor is 
    most often the Social Component, separating rich and poor. Smaller processes appear as 
    the subsequent factors. 
- This analysis depends on measuring the distance between observations, so the choice of metric
is key. Most common are:
    1. Principal Component Analysis: Euclidean metric
    2. Correspondence Analysis: Chi-Square distance
    3. Discriminant Analysis: Generalized Mahalanobis distance

**Spatial autocorrelation**
- Measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space
- Classical autocorrelation statistics include:
    - Moran's *I*
    - Geary's *C*
    - Getis's *G*
    - Standard deviational ellipse
- Each statistic requires measuring a spatial weights matrix reflecting intensity of 
the geographic relationship between observations
- Classic spatial autocorrelation compare spatial weights to the covariance relationship
at pairs of locations
    - Positive autocorrelation indicates clustering of similar values
    - Negative indicates neighbouring values are more dissimilar than expected

**Spatial heterogeneity**
- A property that refers to the uneven distribution of concentrations of each group 
within an area
- A landscape with spatial heterogeneity has a mix of concentrations within an area
- A population with spatial heterogeneity shows various concentrations of individuals 
of this group unevenly distributed across an area (patchily distributed)

**Spatial interaction or gravity models**
- Estimate the flow of people, material, or information between geographic locations
- Factors can include origin propulsive variables, ex. number of commuters, distination
attractiveness, and proximity relationships

**Spatial interpolation**
- Estimate the variables at unobserved locations in geographic space based on other values
- Basic methods include inverse distance weighting
    - Attenuates the variable with decreasing proximity from the observed location
- Sophisticated methods include kriging
    - Interpolates across space according to a spatial lag relationships that has 
    both systematic and random components
    - Provides opitimal estimates given the hypothesized lag relationship
    - Error estimates can be mapped to determine if spatial patterns exist

**Spatial regression**
- Capture spatial dependency in regression analysis
    - Avoid statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable
    significance tests
    - Provide info on spatial relationships among the variables involved
- Spatial depenency can enter the regression model of specific techniques
- Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression
    - Generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis
    - Allows assessment of spatial heterogeneity in the estimated relationships
    between independent and dependent variables
- Spatial stochastic processes are increasingly being deployed in spatial regression analysis
    - Ex. Gaussian processes
    - Model-based versions of GWR, have been applied to conduct Bayesian inference
    - Scalable Gaussian process models such as Gaussian Predictive Processes and 
    Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP)

**Spatial neural networks (SNNs)**
- Subcategory of tailored NNs for representing and predicting geographic phenomena 
- Generally improve the statistical accuracy and reliability of:
    - A-spatial/classic NNs whenever they handle geo-spatial datasets  
    - Other spatial models whenever the spatial datasets' variables depict non-linear
    relationships
- Ex. OFSA SNNs, SVANNs, and GWNNs

**Spatial volatility**
- Describe spatial or spatiotemporal dependence in the conditional variance of a process
    - Extends the concept of Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) from 
    time series to spatial settings
- Account for the fact that variability at one location may be related to variability at 
neighbouring locations, as defined by a spatial weights matrix
- A generalized spatial and spatialtemporal ARCH/GARCH framework allows the conditional 
variance at a location to depend on weighted past squared residuals from neighbouring locations
    - In the spatialtemporal case, also its own past conditional variances
- Applications found in disciplines where risk or uncertainty proagate over space
